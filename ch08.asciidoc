== Pay To Script Hash

So far, we've been doing single-key transactions, ones where only a single private key has to sign in order to disperse the funds. But what if we wanted something a little more complicated? A company that does $100 million in Bitcoin transactions might not want all of the funds in a single public key as that key can be stolen by an employee and all funds lost. What can we do?

The solution is multi-sig, or multiple signatures. This was built into Bitcoin from the beginning, but was a bit clunky at first and so it wasn't used.
